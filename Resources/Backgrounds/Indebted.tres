description = "Your life is not your own, at least not entirely. Whether it's a debt inherited from your family, a desperate gamble gone wrong, or a cruel twist of fate, you owe someone, or something, a significant sum. This burden casts a long shadow over every decision, pushing you to take risks you otherwise wouldn't and forcing you into situations you'd rather avoid. You've learned humility, resourcefulness, and perhaps a touch of desperation. Every coin is precious, every opportunity a potential escape, or a deeper trap. Freedom isn't a given; it's a goal you're constantly striving for."
