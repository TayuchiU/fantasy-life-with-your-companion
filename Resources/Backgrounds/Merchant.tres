description = "Born into the bustling world of trade, you learned early that value isn't just in goods, but in connections. Whether from a family of seasoned traders or a self-made path through sheer grit, your life has been a constant negotiation of prices, pacts, and possibilities. You understand the ebb and flow of supply and demand, the subtle art of persuasion, and the quiet ruthlessness needed to close a deal. You've seen prosperity and scarcity, and you know how to navigate both. Your hands might be clean, but your mind is sharp, always calculating the next advantageous exchange."
